<p>Robert Mbilongoe is a treasure.</p>

<p>He is our lead cocoa farmer and fermentation expert and a third generation cocoa farmer. Mr. Mbilongoe was born and raised on his family&rsquo;s farm in Manganga, a small village in the Centre Region of Cameroon, west Africa, where his family has been cultivating cocoa since the early German colonization (1884-1915), which is when cocoa was first introduced to Cameroon. In addition to cocoa, his family’s farm produces plantains/bananas, mangoes, plums, mandarin oranges, avocados and wild fruit.</p>

<p>Mr. Mbilongoe also learned the art of proper fermentation for cocoa beans from his grandfather, who settled the farm during the very beginning of German colonization. He continued to learn from his father, who lived to be 105 years old. Mr. Mbilongoe still enjoys working his farm, even as he is in his early 70s. He is a well-educated former banker, as well as the former mayor for his region (an area larger than just the small village). His children are all educated and his grandchildren all attend school. The same education ethic is true for all the families in his village.</p>

<p>Mr. Mbilongoe is married with 8 children and 10 grandchildren.</p>

              <h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Fine Cocoa from Cameroon?</span> Yes!</h1>

<p>The small village of Manganga is where we plant our flag.</p>

<p>It is true that properly cultivated, well-fermented and carefully dried fine cocoa has been completely infeasible in Cameroon for more than three decades. The bulk cocoa market simply dominates all cocoa transactions and market demand for well-fermented quality beans is nil. The infrastructure for quality beans simply does not exist. But more than thirty years ago Cameroon supplied high-end cocoa to many European markets, primarily France and Germany. Mr. Mbilongoe saw his grandfather and his father produce very high quality, properly fermented and dried cocoa beans prior to the 1980s. These were fermented in wood boxes lined with banana leaves, and slow dried on elevated wooden racks.</p>

<p>Now, in partnership with Jigoro Investments, Mr. Mbilongoe is organizing the farmers in his village of Manganga to reintroduce the techniques of his youth and to develop the best possible quality cocoa beans. We will centralize fermentation and drying in one location, drawing from approximately a 4km radius. The centrailized fermentation and drying will ensure consistent, high quality, with careful monitoring of fermentation and drying. Mr. Mbilongoe&rsquo;s farm has nearly 7 hectares and there are roughly a dozen more local farmers in Manganga who hope to join the collective, if demand rises to such a level.</p>

<p>In addition to building our fermentation boxes, drying racks and storage houses, much of our work for the past year has been focused on logistics: to build a parallel infrastructure to allow quality beans to be produced and shipped from the heart of industrialized cocoa production. It hasn&rsquo;t been easy. But we have a network that can not bring quality beans to market at scale.</p>

<p>Mr. Mbilongoe is excited to return his farm to quality production.</p>
